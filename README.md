Web scrapping of the best books data from Flipkart


Here, I used BeautifulSoup library for web scrapping of books data from flipkart.

I had extracted most of the books data. Then, filtered books data with Average rating and most no.of reviews, which results in obtaining best books data.

After filtering the obtained data. I had saved the data to an external csv file. Saving the data locally is much more efficient.
